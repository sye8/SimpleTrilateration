# Trilateration
iBeacon based localization with trilateration and position noise filter utilizing Kalman Filter

This branch will be the optimized version

Requires Apache Commons Math 3 and a trilateration algorithm from [here](https://github.com/lemmingapex/trilateration)

Communication with iBeaconDataReceiver requires Google Gson

Also requires my sye8.utils package
